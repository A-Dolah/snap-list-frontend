# SNAP LIST FRONTEND

## Snap List

![Snap List Landing Page](./public/readme-img.png 'Snap List Landing Page')

This is a project that I started building as a _Hack Day Project_ at my time at [School of Applied Technology](https://salt.study/). The purpose of a Hack Day Project is to create any project you want to as long as it has a frontend and a backend.

I chose to make a _shopping list generator_ by implementing a [Clarifai AI Model](https://www.clarifai.com/) to make _food ingredient predictions_ based on pictures of food.

The project went well, but naturally one day of programming isn't nearly enough to make a complete and well-functioning full-stack application. So I've now tried to complete the application using the _MERN Stack_ (_MongoDB_, _Express_, _React_ and _Node.js_). I've also deployed it using _AWS Amplify_ for the frontend, _Heroku_ for the server and _MongoDB Atlas_ for the database.

## Give it a try!

[Here's](https://master.d2lqi2ajg5lzsh.amplifyapp.com/) the link to the application if you want to give it a try.

## Some bugs/issues

I've noticed that since I'm on free plans of Amplify, Heroku and MongoDB, there can be some delays in the performance of the application and even errors.
